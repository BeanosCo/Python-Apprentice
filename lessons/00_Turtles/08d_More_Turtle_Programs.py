"""
Copy the code from the previous lesson, 08a_More_Turtle_programs.ipynb, 
from the section " Click on the Turtle"

Then change the code so that the turtle has a different image ( look in the 'images'
directory ) and when you click on it, it moves to a random location on the screen.

Use this code to get a random x and y location


    import random
    x = random.randint(-300, 300)
    y = random.randint(-300, 300)

screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.bgcolor('white')

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.penup()
t.shape("turtle")

# This is the function that gets called when you click on the screen
def screen_clicked(x, y):
    """Print the x and y coordinates of the screen when clicked.
    and make the turtle move to the clicked location."""
